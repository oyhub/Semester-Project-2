# SemesterProject2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Filter on wines
The app is now set to show all listings from the auctoinhouse API. If you want to only show winebottles that are added from The Wine Seller,
set `ONLY_WINES` in the `app.constants.ts` to `true`.


## Validation Service
To make validation easier, you can use the project's validation service. 
For example, if you set a validationMessage to display errors, you can easily show the correct error
based on what has been incorrectly validated.

Read the documentation for [Validation Service](VALIDATION.md) for more info.
